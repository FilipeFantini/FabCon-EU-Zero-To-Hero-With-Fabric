# Fabric in a Day - Training Overview

## Summary

Introduction to Microsoft Fabric
The training begins with an overview of Microsoft Fabric, focusing on its ability to unify and simplify complex analytics tasks across various subsystems. Participants will gain an understanding of the fragmented nature of modern data stacks and how Microsoft Fabric addresses these challenges by providing a cohesive platform for data integration, governance, and analysis.

## OneLake and Capacity Management

The course introduces OneLake, a lake-centric architecture that integrates data from multiple regions and cloud platforms into a single logical lake, minimizing data duplication and movement. The session also covers Fabric's capacity management, explaining how compute capacities are provisioned and dynamically shared across workloads, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.

## Working with Lakehouses

Participants will explore the Lakehouse architecture, which combines the scalability of a data lake with the analytical power of a data warehouse. The training covers the creation and navigation of Lakehouses, loading data, and transforming it using various tools within the Fabric environment. Labs are included to reinforce these concepts through practical application.

## Dataflows Gen2 and Pipelines

The training delves into Dataflows Gen2, a cloud-based ETL tool that simplifies data preparation and transformation. Participants will learn how to create and use Dataflows to automate data processing tasks. The session also covers the use of Pipelines for orchestrating complex data workflows, including data ingestion, transformation, and loading.

## Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric

Participants are introduced to Apache Spark, an open-source framework for large-scale data processing within Microsoft Fabric. The session covers the basics of Spark, including working with Spark Notebooks and dataframes, schema definition, and utilizing Delta Lake tables for efficient data management.

## Fabric Data Warehouse

The training covers the Fabric Data Warehouse, a modern take on the traditional data warehouse, designed for seamless integration with the Lakehouse. Participants will learn how to create and manage warehouse tables, execute queries, and transform data using SQL. The session also explores different schema designs, such as star and snowflake schemas.

## Analyzing and Visualizing Data

The course concludes with a session on data analysis and visualization, focusing on the creation of semantic models and reports using Power BI. Participants will learn how to prepare data for analysis, create measures, and generate reports that provide actionable insights.
